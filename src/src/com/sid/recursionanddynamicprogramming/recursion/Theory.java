     * How recursion works : On the principles of Mathematical Induction
     *
     * There are two steps :
     *
     * 1. High Level thinking :
     *      1.1 Expectation
     *      1.2 Faith
     *      1.3 Meet Faith With Expectation
     *
     * 2. Low Level Thinking
     *      2.1 Dry Run
     *      2.2 Base Case
     *      2.3 Stack
     *
     *
     * Speaking further to this, recursion can be solved using two principles :
     *
     * 1. Faith Expectation Principle
     *    We start building goes to the base case and  we return back to the original to get the
     *    answers like: GetKeypadCombination , GetMazePaths,GetStairPaths etc.. all the Get ones..
     *
     * 2. Level Option Principles
     *    Here the the solution is build from bottom and gets printed once we are at
     *    top level or at base case  like : PrintStairPaths,PrintKeypadCombination etc..
     *
     *    Level Options :
     *
     *    which ever things are at level : is always passed as parameter in function and it forms our base case
     *    which ever things are available in options : they form the loop inside the function
     *    Ex: Refer permutation and combination questions.
