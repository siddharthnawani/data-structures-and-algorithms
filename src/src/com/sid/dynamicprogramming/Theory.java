     * Three Steps of DP :
     *
     * 1. Storage and meaning : What each array item denotes
     *
     * 2. Direction Identify : in which direction the problem needs to be solved ,
     * that is in which direction the array needs to be traversed and solved
     *
     * 3. Travel and Solve

     * Insight :
     *
     * For duplicacy prepare a 1D dp array ex : target sun subset
     * for no duplicacy prepare a 1D array : coin change permutation/combination
